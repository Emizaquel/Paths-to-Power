In a Xianxia-style world a young student dreams of strange and distant worlds, where knowledge of things not spoken of by those sect-masters that proudly proclaim their skills.

After a few experiments drawn from this strange insight yield some fruit, he strays from the well trodden path of cultivation in order to explore this strange world.

learning to work with all [[Energies|Six Energies]] is far more valuable to him than entrance into a Sect, especially as he learns how to cross over into other worlds.
