## Psion
Psion is the [[Immortal Energy]] of Induction, in a mystical sense it is the energy associated with the ability to produce a desired result with the knowledge you have. It is perhaps the most stable energy, as there are precious few ways to undo learning for a Psion.
## Notes
Psion might seem weak at first, but just as Legacy can effect the past, this has applications beyond the obvious. This energy is able to improve your control over something based on your understanding of it, and unlike Legacy, it is not limited by what is physically possible. Indeed, Psion covers practices similar to Voodoo and Name Magic.

Additionally, the only cost to exploring a new avenue of power is not being able to advance, though
