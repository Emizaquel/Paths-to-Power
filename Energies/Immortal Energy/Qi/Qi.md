## Qi
Qi is the [[Immortal Energy]] of the Soul or the energy of the Self, in a mystical sense it is the energy that defines you as more than simply a pile of tissue and organs, and is both grown through improving your ability to change and resist change from the world around you, and is best at achieving results to this end.

## Notes
This makes Qi powerful, but inflexible, past a certain point. While theoretically any path will allow the growth of a "Virtuous Cycle" attempting to deviate once such a cycle has been established can have immensely deleterious effects on the development and stability of one's Qi

This results in Cultivators being extremely specialised in a single series of skills, usually some progression of a single [[Energies/Immortal Energy/Qi/Technique/Technique|technique]]. Generally, they also pick up some basic skills that come from a developed [[Energies/Immortal Energy/Qi/Spiritual Presence/Spritual Presence|spiritual presence]] and perhaps retain a few broader skills from before they found their path. Additionally some may ape versatility by finding ways to apply their techniques in a variety of ways.
