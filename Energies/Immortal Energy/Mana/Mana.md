## Mana
Mana is the [[Immortal Energy]] of Transformation, in a mystical sense it is the energy aligned with the transition that something undergoes as it moves from one state to another. It is a finicky energy, and it can be said that one never truly cultivates this energy as it only exists in a state of change, though it comes more easily to those experienced in it.

## Notes
Mana is immensely flexible, but this is also it's weakness. Strength in these arts waxes and wanes, and without continued experimentation, exploration and advancement, one may even regress, growing weaker with time.

This generally results in mages being broadly skilled, capable of casting many [[Spell|spells]] That's not to say the mages cannot be specialised. A greater understanding of the changes you want to make, by describing the spell as a large number of changes rather than a singular event, you can more effectively use and supply mana. Mages can also change themselves, binding themselves with [[Energies/Immortal Energy/Mana/Vow/Vow|vows]] or taking on [[Energies/Immortal Energy/Mana/Mutation/Mutation|mutations]] in order to allow themselves to handle a larger amount of mana per change they wish to enact.
