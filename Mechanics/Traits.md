Characters have traits which influence their relationship with [[Challenges]] - those they undertake and those that involve them.

Traits are comprised of conditions and effects, and have key values
## Trait Creation
Traits are generally given for completing key challenges as is relevant to the plot or specific character. This might mean achieving some specific character goal or simply advancing the story. This is generally up to the GM, and can be spontaneous or a specific goal that players work towards.
## Conditions
This can be fairly broad, but generally falls into the category of "If challenge involves 'x' then do ..." - where 'x' is another character, place or activity - anything really. What needs to be done generally falls one of the following categories of effects, if not, the effect will be explained in detail.
## Effect
This is a description of what the trait does, and generally describes changes to the dice pool or specific altercations to [[Key Values]].
## Trait Resolution
Traits are - by default - executed in chronological order, based on order in which those traits are acquired by the character. This may be altered by various meta traits but may also be altered by special events.
