A challenge is any non-trivial action that a character might undertake. Challenges have one or more success thresholds denoting specific outcomes. 


## Challenge Resolution
By default a character rolls a number of d100 equal to their level and the total is compared to one or more success thresholds. Not all of these thresholds may be made available to the player(s).

The use of a total is intended to limit the influence of low-relevance challenges on progression since extreme outcomes are less likely.
 - The number of dice being equal to the character's level is used to reflect that higher level characters are also just generally more capable.
## Challenge Creation Guidelines
challenge creation guidelines - A challenge generally happens when (a) player(s) wants to do something that wouldn't be easy for the character in question to accomplish. Generally this results in the default success condition being the character pulling off what the player wants.
- A challenge is generally considered trivial if there's at worst a 10% chance that the character will fail that action. If character does not experience any consequence to failing (such as running down some time limit, becoming damaged or spending some resource) then take into account the ability for that character to simply try  again when calculating triviality.
- A guideline for setting success thresholds for simple tasks would be the likelihood that an average person would be able to pull it off.
- For more complex tasks take into account the sort of person that would be good at such a task.
